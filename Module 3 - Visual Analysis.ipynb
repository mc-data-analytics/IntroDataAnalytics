    "\n",
    "Histograms are charts that show the distribution of data. In other words, histograms show where the data is gathered or clustered together (values occur frequently) and where they are sparse. A histogram can also help identify the area(s) where there might be outliers.\n",
    "\n",

When the data is clustered on the right side, it has a **left-skew** (the sparse values spread out towards the left) and data clustered on the left side is a **right-skew** (sparse values are spread out towards the right). The sparse values on either side of the distribution are called the **tails**."

On each end of the boxplot are the **whiskers**, or fences, to mark the lower and upper ends for where there may be outliers in the data.\n",
